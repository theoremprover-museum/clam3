%            Consider Finished hint method.
%
%	This hint method stops the planning process in the branch where
% it is called. It is useful when not all the methods to finish the proof
% are available and the user is not interested in this branch anymore.
% Rather than letting the planner fail because it couldnt solve the simplest
% parts of the proof, the user may consider them finished and continue 
% planning. The Input parameter is the sequent at which the planning process 
% was stopped.
