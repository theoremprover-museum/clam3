% GEN_THM hint method. 
%
%	Generalises a theorem into another more general already
%  loaded. Thm is the name of the theorem to be generalised. The
%  hint method first verifies the theorem is in memory. Then it verifies
%  it is in fact more general than the theorem being proved. It does so
%  by replacing a universally quantified variable from Thm by a
%  metavariable and then tries to apply sym_eval method to it and obtain
%  the theorem being proved as a result. If it fails, it will backtrack 
%  get the next universally quantified variable and try again until all
%  such variables have been tried.
