	% LEMMA METHOD: optionally loaded. Is useful in places, but
	% expensive in general.
	% Bit of a hack to deal with commutativity of =.
	% Possibly a more elegant solution to this would be to teach
	% instantiate/3 about the commutativity of =, but that would
	% increase the general cost of instantiate/3.
