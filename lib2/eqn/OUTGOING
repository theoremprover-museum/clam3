Hi Randy!!!

Glad to hear from you.

I'll come back to you soon with an answer to your question.

In principle, we would be very glad to have you spend that time
at ITESM.

Say the family hello. Hope Lannie is doing fine.

I am proof-planning the n-bit Adder verification theorem. There is a

I gave up. May be you can help me.

The theorem is in my directory ~francisc/clam/lib and you load it with
lib_load(thm(nAdderVer)). The needs file ~francisc/clam/lib/needs has
all the required entries.

I display the partial planning and the error I get:

Right, you seem to have very good choices and I am glad.
I have one question. You said that your average salary is around 4,000
.00 dollars,what about taxes? is that figure before or after taxes,
are tthe taxes paid in Japan or in Canada?.

Shortly, ITESM will make you a concrete offer for the April-August period.

That is a very interesting culture, isn't it?

I am sure that is a very intersting experience particularly, being the

I circumvented the problem the following way:

The n-bit Adder verification theorem was:

[]==>n:pnat=>a:{word}=>b:{word}=>ci:{bool}=>nAdderSpec(n,a,b,ci)=numVal(nAdderImp(n)ofa of b of ci) in pnat. 

and I changed it to:

[]==>ci:{bool}=>n:pnat=>a:{word}=>b:{word}=>nAdderSpec(n,a,b,ci)
=numVal(nAdderI\mp(n)ofaof b of ci) in pnat. 

that is, I put the ci:{bool} first and also, I loaded the bool_cases
method first, and the problem disappeared. Apparently, it couldn't
deal with the equation bitval(ci)=bitval(ci)+0, because the bool_case
method wasn't available.

It proceeded long further, in fact tha planning process stopped after
1.5 hours, without being able to produce the required proof plan yet.
However, this represents some progress though. I will keep working on it.

The theorem is planned by Clam for specific values of n, a, b and ci, though.

In fact, both the specification nAdderSpec and the implementation
numVal(nAdderImp) work correctly when evaluated with Prolog's eval command.

Also, I have to explicitly load the true definition, since the
built-in true cannot be override. This doesn't happen with the pnat_eq
definition which does override the built-in pnat_eq. I wonder why.

Regards

Francisco

That's fine, no problem.

Regarding the corresponding equation:

> Just  all(p) = and( p of true, p of false ) in bool .

the question is how to declare p, as Oyster is giving a syntax error
because it must be declared with some type. This is the original
question I tried to pose (but I didn't make it clear).

I give:

[]==>all(p)=and(p of {true},p of {false}) in {bool}.

and I get (as expected):

syntax error: p (three times)

That makes a lot of sense (after I see it). It worked, indeed, thanks.

I am trying the relational verification of circuits, starting with
their representation and the verification of non-recursive circuits
(1-bit Adder). There shouldn't be any problem verifying these
circuits, and I hope to report this proof soon.

After this, I will try the recursive ones, where I will address again
the wave-rule parsing and rippling problems.

Subject: type of a lambda abstraction
To: smaill
Cc: francisc

Alan:

I gave the definitions and equations for all and some.

Now, I am trying to prove that:
for all x [for all y ~(x->y) = ~(exists y (x->y))]

In Oyster syntax this is:

[]==>x:{bool}=>(all(lambda(y,not(imp(x,y))))=not(some(lambda(y,imp(x,y))))
in {bool}).

the proof planning proceeds by using dplan. After base_case,
bool_cases and base_case again, it fails in calculating the type of a
lambda abstraction, that is, it can not deal with:

(lambda(y,not y)of{true}and lambda(y,not y)of{false})= (not lambda(y,y)of\
{true}or lambda(y,y)of{false})in{bool}

procedure find_type/3 works for definitions that have associated a
synth theorem, but here we have an anonymous function (a lambda
abstraction).
Should find_type/3 be extended?, or may be I am missing something
else. The method bool_cases doesn't deal with this situation, anyway.

The equivalence above is true for any predicate p of type bool=>bool,
but here I am giving an instance of p, that is imp(x,y), which has
type bool=>bool=>bool. There seems to be a conflict with types, isn't it?

The question is:
if x is of type bool and p is of type bool=>bool then how does
procedure find_type/3 detrmines that the type of lambda(x,p of x) must
be bool.

I added the following clauses to find_type/3, but it is not working yet:

find_type(Hyps,lambda(X,F),({bool}=>{bool})):-find_type(Hyps,X,{bool})
,find_type(Hyps,F,{bool}).
find_type(Hyps,lambda(X,F) of X,({bool}=>{bool})):-find_type(Hyps,X,

I managed to verify the carry n-bit adder using the little endian

get more that 10 different proof plans.

I'll report this proof in a note.

Have a good trip back to Italy.
