AlanB, AlanS:

The errors in BB note 935 are embarrasing, but they are just that,
transcription errors due to the hurry in writing the note. The definitions
and equations pointed out by Shankar and Sree have not changed since I
wrote them in early June, for instance:

ls -l subtractW
-rw-r--r--  1 francisc       58 Jun  9 23:28 subtractW

so the proof I did it as I explain in the message sent to Sree. It may
look like I changed the definitions after they pointed out the errors
in the note, which of course is not the case.

Francisco
